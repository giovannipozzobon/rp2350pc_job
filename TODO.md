# TODO list

## Console module
- Cursor
- Other control characters.
- Console logger to replace serial logger ?

## Sprite module
- Initially requires 2 buffers, drawBuffer copied to displayBuffer and rendered on top.

## Others
- python script with skeleton for runtimes CMakeLists.txt
- builder to allow libraries that aren't in the dependency list (e.g. input and usb in console, for testing keyboard.)
