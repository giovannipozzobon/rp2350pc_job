# TODO list

## Console module
- Console logger to replace serial logger ?
- Graphics will need some help, could have a 'can draw' function ?
- Use own mapping ?

## Sprite module
- Initially requires 2 buffers, drawBuffer copied to displayBuffer and rendered on top.

## Others
- python script with skeleton for runtimes CMakeLists.txt
