# TODO list

- Check mouse works and flatten it (requires mouse).
- Check the video works (another experiment)
- Recode the HID Handler for a half decent interface because it's rubbish now.
- Code the FATFS Interface. Lose CWD I think !
- Convert to a module.
- Keyboard processing module.
- Video module.
